# [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016/about)

These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2016. In general, with the exception of added comments, my solutions will be left as I had them upon initially solving the challenges, allowing me to review what sort of choices I make when programming with an emphasis on speed. I *may* try my hand at solving the challenges in C++ a second time, just so I know how to think about the problems in a more low-level sense.

Consider solving the problems yourself before looking at my solutions.
